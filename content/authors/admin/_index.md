I am currently a second-year doctoral student in the [Linguistics Department](https://linguistics.ku.edu) at [the University of Kansas](https://ku.edu), under the supervision of [Dr. Fiorentino](http://people.ku.edu/~fiore355/), [Dr. Gabriele](http://people.ku.edu/~gabriele/), and [Dr. Minai](http://people.ku.edu/~minai/). My research mainly investigates first and second language acquisition of morphosyntax and semantics with the use of psycholinguistic (e.g., eye-tracking) and brain-imaging (e.g., EEG) techniques. In particular, I am interested in exploring how first and second language learners comprehend sentences in real time, with regards to the effects of individual differences (e.g., working memory), cross-linguistic influences, and other factors, on the cognitive processes of language processing and acquisition.

Before coming to KU Linguistics, I was trained in linguistic theory and communication sciences and disorders (CSD) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu). I received training in the Diversity in Language and Literacy Lab at the [CSD Department](https://thecollege.syr.edu/department-communication-sciences-disorders/), and am excited about working on typical and atypical language acquisition among bilingual children in the future. Besides, from the perspective of theoretical linguistics, I worked on a syntax project on the light verb structure in Teochew, as well as a phonological project on the tone circle phenomenon in Teochew, at the [Languages, Literature, & Linguistics Department](https://thecollege.syr.edu/languages-literatures-and-linguistics/). I would also be interested in future research on the syntax of Chinese languages.

Currently, I am developing my research interests in computational linguistics and receiving training in computer science and programming. I would love to employ computational modelling for my research on language processing. 

I also moonlight as an applied linguist, and I conducted research in language learning and teaching in the past few years.
