I have taught a diverse range of courses at the college level in the United States across in-person, online, and hybrid formats. During my graduate study at Syracuse University, I worked as an instructor of Chinese for two years. At the University of Kansas, I have been working both as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and as the instructor of record for linguistics courses. I have also delivered guest lectures in First-Year Seminar on Language, Thought and Culture and Neurolinguistics I. 

Across these experiences, I have shaped my teaching philosophy that is student-centered and is focused on creating environments that allow all students to participate and to develop skills to become independent thinkers and researchers.
