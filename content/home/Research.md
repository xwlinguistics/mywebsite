### ðŸ§  Neurolinguistics & Language Processing

I examine how the brain represents and processes words and sentences in real time in L1 and L2, and how **linguistic factors** (e.g., cross-linguistic influence) and individual differences in **cognitive abilities** (e.g., working memory, verbal abilities) modulate real-time language comprehension.

**Selected Publications & Presentations**
- Wang, X., Fiorentino, R., & Gabriele, A. (under review). *Examining individual differences in the processing of long-distance dependencies in L1 and L2 English.* Submitted to **Language Learning**.
- Wang, X., Gabriele, A., & Fiorentino, R. (2025). *Investigating sensitivity to binding constraints in L1 and L2 English using ERPs.* Poster presented at the **Society for the Neurobiology of Language** Meeting (SNL 2025), September 12â€“14, 2025.
- Wang, X., Gabriele, A., & Fiorentino, R. (2025). *Examining sensitivity to subject-verb agreement in a second language (L2): An ERP investigation.* Poster presented at the **Cognitive Neuroscience Society** meeting, March 29â€“April 1, 2025.


### ðŸ‘¶ Developmental Psycholinguistics

This strand investigates how **typical and atypical** learners, including bilingual children and children with language disorders, acquire **abstract grammatical and semantic knowledge**, and how language experience and cognitive resources affect developmental trajectories.

**Selected Publications & Presentations**
- Wang, X., & Minai, U. (under review). *Childrenâ€™s use of discourse cues to resolve ambiguity: A case study on Mandarin-speaking childrenâ€™s comprehension of ambiguous wh-adjuncts.* Submitted to **First Language**.

- Wang, X., & Shi, Y. (2025). *Examining mother-child interaction input quality and its impact on late talkersâ€™ lexical and syntactic development.* Poster presented at the **Cognitive Science 2025**, July 30â€“August 2, 2025.



### ðŸ¤– Computational and Educational Approach to Language

I integrate **NLP** and **LLM-based analyses** to analyze discourse and text use. I also conduct studies that translate linguistics and psychology research into educational practice.

**Selected Publications & Presentations**
