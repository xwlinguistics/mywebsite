Project title: Individual differences and L2 pronominal dependencies processing: an ERP study
- This project investigates the role of working memory and cognitive control in the on-line processing of L2 pronouns (e.g., him/her) and reflexives (e.g., himself/herself) by Chinese-speaking learners of English. Specifically, the project examines whether L1 and L2 processing are similar of different, using a measure of high temporal resolution, and investigates to what extent working memory and cognitive control may account for variances in the online processing patterns. 
- This project is being conducted at the [neurolinguistics & language processing lab](http://www.neuroling.ku.edu) by [Xuan Wang](https://xwlinguist.netlify.app) for his qualifying paper and master project, under the supervision of [Dr. Fiorentino](http://people.ku.edu/~fiore355/), [Dr. Gabriele](http://people.ku.edu/~gabriele/).
