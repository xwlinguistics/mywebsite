Project title: A sketch of Mbat syntax and phonology

Mbat is a Jarawan language, also called Jarawan Bantu, which is mainly spoken by people from Bauchi State in Nigeria. There are approximately 40 thousand Mbat native speakers, and this language is still not well documented in literature. during the Spring semester 2020, a fieldwork with a native Mbat speaker was conducted in the field methods course at Syracuse University. After working with the consulant for about 4 months, some valuable data have been collected and we wrote a sketch of Mbat syntax/phonology, including some syntactic components of Mbat such as the nouns, adjectives, pronouns, demonstratives, numerals, negations, subordinate sentences, as well as the phonological patterns, tones, vowels and consonant inventory.
