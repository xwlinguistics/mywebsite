Project title: The effects of L1 and inherent morpheme difficulty on developmental morpheme acquisition by Mandarin-English and Spanish-English bilingual children
- This project utilizes the language data from [CHILDES](https://childes.talkbank.org).We particularly explore the data sets from Chinese-English as well as Spanish-English bilingual children aged between 3-6. As Spanish is an agglutinative language while Chinese is an isolating language, the role of L1 in L2 morpheme acquisition would be compared. Besides, we also examine whether the inherent difficulty (e.g., semantic complexity, morphonological regularity) will play a certain role in the acquisition. 
- This project is being conducted at the DILL Lab by [Xuan Wang](https://xwlinguist.netlify.app) in collabration with [Yan Shi](https://faculty.utah.edu/u1371504-YAN_SHI/research/index.hml) and [Dr. McMillen](https://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/stephanie-mcmillen/).
