Project title: The acquisition of ambiguous wh-adjuncts by Mandarin-speaking children: the roles of prosody and order of mention
- This project examines 3-5-year-old Mandarin-speaking children's acquisition of Mandarin wh-adjunct zenme, by manipulating the prosodic stress and the order of mention. Children will listen to 4 stories in Mandarin, with manner and causal readings of zenme established in each story; then they will answer a question. Currently 
- This project is being conducted at the Developmental Psycholinguistics Lab by [Xuan Wang](https://xwlinguist.netlify.app) and [Dr. Minai](http://people.ku.edu/~minai/).
