Project title: The effect of L1, L2 proficiency and language exposure on bilingual word recognition: A visual world eye-tracking study
- This project examines the spoken word processing in English by two groups of bilingual participants (i.e., English-Chinese bilinguals and Chinese-English bilinguals). We are interested in exploring the role of L1 and L2 proficiency, and the lanaguage exposure, using the eye-tracking visual world paradigm.  
- This project is being conducted at the DILL Lab by [Yan Shi](https://faculty.utah.edu/u1371504-YAN_SHI/research/index.hml) in collabration with [Xuan Wang](https://xwlinguist.netlify.app) and [Dr. McMillen](https://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/stephanie-mcmillen/).
